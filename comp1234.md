## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- **Bit**: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).  
- **Byte**: Group of 8 bits.  
- **Binary Numbers**: Numbers represented using base 2.  
- **Volatile Memory**: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).  
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).
- **Unsigned Numbers**: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.  
- **Signed Numbers**: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.  
- **Fractional Numbers**: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.
- **ASCII Table**: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').  
- **Control Codes**: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).
## Lecture 3: Structure of Text  
- **Markdown**:  
  - Simple syntax for formatting.  
  - Titles: `# Title`, `## Subtitle`  
  - Italic: `_italic_`  
  - Bold: `**bold**`  
  - Lists: `* item` or `- item`  
  - Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.  
- **Special Characters**:  
  - Non-alphanumeric symbols like `@`, `#`, `$`, `&`, `*`.  
  - Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.  
  - Example: `\#` to display `#` in Markdown.
# Lecture 4: Manipulating Text & Text Editors  
- **Types**:  
  - Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).  
- **Popular Editors**:  
  - **Vim**: Command-line based, requires learning commands.  
    - Exit command: `:q!`  
  - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Widely used, feature-rich.  
    - Extensions and themes available.  
- **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.
  - **Basic Search**: Use `Ctrl + F` for finding text.  
- **Advanced Search**:  
  - **Wildcards**: Use `*` for any character sequence.  
  - **Regex (Regular Expressions)**: For pattern matching.  
    - Example: `line\d+` finds "line" followed by digits.
  ## Lecture 5 Summary: Command Line Interfaces
  - **Navigation and File Management**:  
  - `ls`: List files in a directory.  
  - `cd`: Change directory.  
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.  
  - `cat`: Display file contents.  
  - `less`: View file contents interactively.  
  - `cp`: Copy files.  
  - `mv`: Move files.  
  - `mkdir`: Create a directory.  
  - `ping`: Test network connectivity.
   - `grep`: Search text using patterns.  
  - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.
 - **SSH (Secure Shell)**:  
  - Connect to remote computers securely.  
  - Allows command line access to remote systems.  
    
- **File Transfer**:  
  - `scp`: Securely copy files between computers.  
  - `sftp`: Secure file transfer protocol.
 
- **Interactive Tools**:  
  - `htop`: Monitor system processes and resource usage.  
  - `tmux`: Terminal multiplexer for managing multiple sessions.
